# More Websockets

We made Bratty app today, and added a number of functionalities to it:

/me commands
/active to toggle our active state
/dog to fetch a random dog from the [Dog API](https://dog.ceo/dog-api/)
/gif to query the [Giphy search engine](https://developers.giphy.com/docs/)
We also talked about DSLs or Domain-specific Languages and gave the example of the functions inside Excel.
