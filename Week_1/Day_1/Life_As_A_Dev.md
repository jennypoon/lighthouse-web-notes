###Life as a Dev

Welcome to Bootcamp!

We covered three key topics today:

1. Curriculum & Evaluation
This was focused on the various ways in which we will set up challenges and evaluations for you in the bootcamp. We talked about Compass submissions, assistance requests, Tech Interviews, Project Evals, and what was in your syllabus. We also talked about THE TEST. That presentation can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1085vkXP2Irmw4SDs8rqhOGSGLQaRal6O/view).

2. Tooling & Digital Fluency
We talked about keyboard shortcuts and why they were important to be able to put you in control of your efficiency and your environment. We referenced [Sublime Tutor](https://sublimetutor.com/) as a resource for learning shortcuts in Sublime. We also talked about some system shortcuts such as Cut/Copy/Paste, close and re-opening tabs in Chrome, as well as a number of other commands and shortcuts.

3. git

##Git

Version Control Systems or Source Code Management

#Track Changes in MS Word is a VCS.

2006

* BitKeeper - SCM
* BitKeeper claimed that the kernel team "reverse engineered" his product
* Linus Torvalds
  * Brilliant coder
  * Volcanic temper
* Conditions:
  * Fast
  * Smart
  * Distributed
  * Secure
* Apr 3, 2006 - Linus announces he's building his own
* Apr 6, 2006 - Linus announces he's done
* Apr 9, 2006 - git was self-hosting
* Apr 12, 2006 - First release of Linux kernel from git

Downside to git:

* There are a lot of commands
* The developers had english as a second language, so some commands are confusing
* Some commands do very different things, depending on options
* 11 commands in git you need to know
